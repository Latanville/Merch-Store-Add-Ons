<b><h1> Fourthwall Add-Ons require a Proxy Server! </b> </h1>

<b><ul>Overview</b></ul>

Fourthwall allows you to enhance your website or shop with custom scripts and code. However, to use APIs that require authentication (e.g., donation data), you must ensure your API keys are not exposed in the browserâ€™s source code or network logs.

<b><ul>Why You Need a Proxy Server</b></ul>

<b>Security</b>: API keys should never be included in client-side code, as they can be easily accessed and misused.

<b>Data Privacy</b>: Protect sensitive data exchanged with external APIs.

<b>Ease of Maintenance</b>: Centralize and update API logic on the server without modifying website code.
